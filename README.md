# Ising-confusion
## Classifying the phases in an Ising Model using confusion scheme.

Classifying phases in Ising model using ANN and implementing the confusion scheme by deliberately mislabelling the data around the critical temperature. 
The data was sampled using metropolis algorithm. A simple neural network was trained on the sampled to data to identify the phases. 

Confusion can be considered as a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. It acts an unsupervised learning model when the data is mislabelled.
